# Scheme Logic

This is more a fun exercise for myself than anything really useful. I've wanted to
dig into scheme for awhile and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.

This is a program that implements all the logical operators using only three lambda calculus
based functions: TRUE, FALSE, and NOT.  The eventual goal of this project is to make a logical
adder using only functions built up from the original three.
